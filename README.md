# moodle-lifecycle-movecategorystep
[WIP] This is a step-subplugin for the admin tool [moodle-tool_lifecycle](https://github.com/learnweb/moodle-tool_lifecycle). 
It simply moves the triggered courses to a category which can be specified in the step configuration.
For example, here at the University of WÃ¼rzburg we use this plugin to move older courses to an invisible category (before we finally delete them).

## Settings
Site administrators selects one category (from a dropdown) where the courses will be moved to.
